This Codebase is dedicated to my journey in learning React-Native App development in hope to creeate an app for android and Apple. 

I am following the tutorial from Javascript Mastery linked below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCUegTZF7M

The main goal is to learn so the code, as done in many small commits was heavily, and I mean heavily commented to explain the process of how everything is working with eachother. 

Some downloads required were: 
- Expo
- React Native
- Tailwind CSS

External Application being Used: 
- Expo Go App
- Appwrite Free Database
